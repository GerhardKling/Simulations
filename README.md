# Simulations
This repository contains material for the playlist on simulations hosted by YUNIKARN. Visit us on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@YUNIKARN)

# V1: Why do we need simulations - don't we have enough data?
This video introduces our new playlist dedicated to simulations. This is a joint project with our YouTube partner Julian (https://www.youtube.com/c/JulianRighSampedro). This introduction addresses the following questions: (1) Don’t we have enough data? (2) Why are simulations useful? – and (3) What will you learn? In this playlist, we will explore applications in Statistics, Finance, and Physics. Finally, you will learn how to code simulations in various programming languages, including Python, R, Stata and OpenBugs/WinBugs. Moreover, we need to speed up our code using various methods.

# V2: How to simulate a Random Walk in Python?
This video demonstrates the simulation of a random walk in Python. Random walks appear in many disciplines, including Physics and Finance. In the context of Finance, theory suggests that current share prices can be written as the share price in the previous period plus a random process representing public information. We discuss step-by-step the implementation of a Random Walk simulation in Python.

# V3: How to simulate share prices in Python? 
This video demonstrates the simulation of a share price in Python. Using Yahoo Finance, we look at real financial data and explore drifts in a Random Walk model. Random Walks need to be modified as share prices could become negative. We explore Geometric Brownian Motion and its properties based on Osborne (1959) and Fama (1965). Finally, we implement a simulation in Python that has the desired properties.

# V4: Can technical analysis predict share prices?
Does technical analysis work? One has to accept that there are theoretical challenges to the idea that technical analysis can be used to predict share prices. In addition, empirical evidence suggests that stock returns are hard to predict. This video illustrates the issues using real financial data. I talk you through an implementation of trading strategies in Python. Using simple moving averages, we will generate trading signals and calculate our profits. Will we succeed? Finally, I will discuss how you can learn more about technical analysis without spending "silly money" on online courses and "special" software. DIY is the way to do it! Let's get ready to code and trade!

# V5: How to simulate interest rates in Python?
This video explains the Vasicek (1977) model, which can be used to simulate interest rates. There are many applications in finance and risk management where simulated interest rates can be useful. Vasicek model belongs to the class of one-factor interest rate models. These models have in common that only one factor (the market factor) drives interest rates. I will explain how this model works and how we can implement the model in Python. We will create our own class and two methods. The first method generates a Wiener process and the second method provides simulated interest rates using the Vasicek model.

# V6: The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Model in Python
In a previous video, we developed the Rate class, which enables us to simulate interest rates using the Vasicek (1977) model. We will extend our class by adding a new method that uses the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Model. The difference is in the stochastic volatility component, which is scaled by the square root of past interest rates. Hence, volatility increases in an environment with high interest rates, which is in line with empirical evidence.
