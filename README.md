# Simulations
This repository contains material for the playlist on simulations hosted by YUNIKARN. Visit us on https://www.yunikarn.com

# V1: Why do we need simulations - don't we have enough data?
This video introduces our new playlist dedicated to simulations. This is a joint project with our YouTube partner Julian (https://www.youtube.com/c/JulianRighSampedro). This introduction addresses the following questions: (1) Don’t we have enough data? (2) Why are simulations useful? – and (3) What will you learn? In this playlist, we will explore applications in Statistics, Finance, and Physics. Finally, you will learn how to code simulations in various programming languages, including Python, R, Stata and OpenBugs/WinBugs. Moreover, we need to speed up our code using various methods.

# V2: How to simulate a Random Walk in Python?
This video demonstrates the simulation of a random walk in Python. Random walks appear in many disciplines, including Physics and Finance. In the context of Finance, theory suggests that current share prices can be written as the share price in the previous period plus a random process representing public information. We discuss step-by-step the implementation of a Random Walk simulation in Python.

#V3: How to simulate Share Prices in Python? 
This video demonstrates the simulation of a share price in Python. Using Yahoo Finance, we look at real financial data and explore drifts in a Random Walk model. Random Walks need to be modified as share prices could become negative. We explore Geometric Brownian Motion and its properties based on Osborne (1959) and Fama (1965). Finally, we implement a simulation in Python that has the desired properties.
